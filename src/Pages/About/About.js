            <h5 className='container mt-5 mb-5'>I, Farhan Md. Siraj, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate, has expertise designing and developing numerous websites with React. I am driven by a desire to learn about the latest technologies accessible for app development. I consider myself a "forever learner," keen to improve on my development background and remain up to date on the latest technology.
            I am presently learning React with the goal of becoming a front-end developer in the near future. After 5 years, I perceive myself as a full stack developer creating various apps to solve the difficulties we encounter in our daily lives. To acheive my goal I am trying to code everyday for about 8-10 hour per day. I try to understand the code rather than memorizing it. To connect, send an email to farhansafin97@yahoo.com!</h5>
